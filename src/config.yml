# IMPORTANT: If you enable the "check-lore" option, the plugin will consider that the item has enchantment if
# it contains the enchantment's display in its lore. That means an item might have an enchantment effect without
# having a Rune applied on it (mostly useful when you want custom enchantment effect on items in a pre-made kit).

# If you modify the lore display of any enchantment, items having older display would stop having that enchantment's effect.

# Configuration for mob drops ---
# You can set default drops for each type of mob or you can set drops particularly for some mob.
# From the config below, for all mobs other than Creeper, drops would be taken from the "default" field.
# For Creeper, the drops would be taken from the "CREEPER" field.
# You can add more mobs like this. Choose the enums from here:
# https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html

# Drop format is [enchantment name];[enchantment level] : [chance of drop]
# If you want any level to be dropped, you can ignore the ";[enchantment level]" part.
